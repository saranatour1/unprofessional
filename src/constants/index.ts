  I have a few reasons that made me decide to do this career shift, one of which is me being petty that in my graduation project I wasn't allowed to experiment 
  with creating my own analytics website, for my data, and it was a thing that interested me for a couple of years to look into.
  its an interesting new path, with a lot of new challenges, no path has a no obstacles, and what interests me about this one is that you always have something to learn,
  and you'll always find a community to answer your questions if you have any!`;
